## Description

This is an application that will allow a user to select a playlist based upon their mood or create their own. Members of Mood Setter can scroll through the pre made playlists curated by the application or make playlists depending on the mood they seek. In order to access the functionality of Mood Setter, users must first become members by signing up. The playlists are brought in via YouTube and are available to users once they've logged in.  A member can input their own playlist by assigning a name, mood, description, and linking the YouTube playlist of their choice.  Deployed link: https://project-2-mood-music.herokuapp.com/
